This challenge grabbed my attention as it was such a perfect fit for some CSS Grid practice. I also liked the whole design of the page and I wanted to go for
coding a mobile nav on my own without any tutorials or using Bootstrap. <br>
One tricky part was "graying out" the page when the user opens the mobile navbar. <br>
All in all the project could be improved with animations, especially for the mobile navbar. Might do that in the future.
